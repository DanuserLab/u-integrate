function fittedCorVec = smoothingSplineCorMap(corMap)
% smoothingSplineCorMap Compute an averaged correlation curve over windows
% by applying smoothingspline via fit.m function. The smoothingParam is
% chosen to be twice of the default one. This function handles NaN
% correlations by simply removing in the fit.
