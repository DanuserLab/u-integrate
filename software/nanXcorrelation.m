function xcvec = nanXcorrelation(x, y, maxLag)
% nanXcorrelation Compute cross correlations between x and y vectors in a
% fashion that can handle many NaN's. It computes a cross product of
% centered x and y, and then normalize it based nanstd and effective sample
% sizes of x and y vectors. If there is no NaN value, then it coincides
% with xcorr.m function.
