% Updated 
% J Noh, 2018/04/03. Fix all nan case.
% 2017/03/31: 
%           Instead of mean(), it uses smoothingSpline.

numLayer = numel(xcorrMatCell);
lagMax = (size(xcorrMatCell{1}, 2) - 1)/2;

CMLags = cell(numLayer, 1);
for l = 1:numLayer
    xcmat = xcorrMatCell{l};
    %xcmeanVec = mean(xcmat, 1, 'omitnan');
    % all nan case
    if all(isnan(xcmat))
        xcmeanVec = mean(xcmat, 1, 'omitnan');
    else
    xcmeanVec = smoothingSplineCorMap(xcmat);
    end
    
    [r0, i] = max(abs(xcmeanVec));
    l0 = i - lagMax - 1;
    r1 = xcmeanVec(i);
